# InternJobs.ai App

This app is the authenticated product surface for `app.internjobs.ai`.

It is intentionally separate from the marketing site:

- `apps/marketing` deploys to Cloudflare Pages for `internjobs.ai`.
- `apps/app` deploys to Fly.io for LinkedIn signup, waitlist onboarding, channel pairing, and the future student agent experience.

The current server is a small Fly-ready shell with `/healthz`. The next milestone will add Clerk, Neon, Photon/Spectrum webhooks, and the waitlist flows.
